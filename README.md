Inventory Management System : Containing a Grocery Product Database

## Grocery Database
Initially it contains 35 grocery product information. 
Information : Product Id, Product Name, Price, Quantity, Date Of Manufacture, Date of expiry.

## Functions
In this Inventory Management, I have added the functionality of Adding the new grocery products and the updating the existing Grocery Product Database. 
Second, I have added the billing functionality and storing the sold items in a new Grocery Sales file.
Billing contains the name of product, qunatity of product, time of purchase, price of product and total amount.
